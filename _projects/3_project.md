### Dynamic Trust Assessment of V2X messages and actors is now possible

The cornerstone of the CONNECT project is its Trust Assessment Framework (TAF), which enables continuous assessment and dynamic trust establishment, addressing both data trustworthiness and the trust level of entities within the CCAM ecosystem.
* Dynamic Trust Models: CONNECT’s Trust Model Manager (TMM) builds dynamic trust models that capture and maintain multiple trust relationships among different data sources and entities. These models adapt to real-time changes, ensuring that trust assessments remain relevant throughout system operation.
* Evidence-Based Trust Evaluation: The Trust Level Evaluation Engine (TLEE) leverages observable evidence and referral-based relationships to dynamically evaluate the trustworthiness of data sources and observations. This probabilistic approach ensures robust and accurate trust assessments, even under changing network and operational conditions.

### Runtime Monitoring and Trust-Based Security Claims

The CONNECT project integrates trusted computing capabilities directly into CCAM entities, creating a “network of trust” through continuous attestation and verification mechanisms.
* Roots of Trust for Vehicles: By embedding trusted computing bases within vehicle electronic control units (ECUs) and sensors, CONNECT enables runtime attestation of device integrity, configuration, and software execution. This capability ensures real-time verification of each component’s security status.
* Secure Evidence Sharing: Security claims generated during trust assessments are shared with other entities in a privacy-preserving manner, maintaining data integrity while mitigating risks associated with information exposure. Advanced cryptographic constructs, such as anonymous threshold signatures, enable zero-knowledge proofs of trust, preserving user privacy without compromising security.

### Applying Digital Twin Technology for Enhanced Trust and Efficiency

CONNECT has extended the application of digital twins into the realm of trust assessment, leveraging this concept to optimize and offload resource-intensive tasks in a secure manner.
* Digital Twin as a Trust Enabler: By creating synchronized digital replicas of vehicles and CCAM nodes, CONNECT facilitates secure computation offloading to Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) environments. These digital twins operate within Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), maintaining confidentiality and integrity throughout all operations.
