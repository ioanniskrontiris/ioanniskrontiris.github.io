I am currently working as Senior Research Engineer at the [European Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) of Huawei in Munich, Germany.   

I hold a Ph.D. Degree in Computer Science from [University of Mannheim](http://www.uni-mannheim.de/1/english/) in Germany, and a M.Sc. Degree in Information Technology from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.ini.cmu.edu/) in USA.  
An overview of my current and past positions:

* Senior Research Engineer - Security and Privacy at the [European Research Center](http://www.huawei.eu/research-and-innovation) of [Huawei Technologies](https://www.huawei.com/en/) in Munich, Germany
* Senior Researcher & Project Manager – Privacy Technology at [Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany](http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/en)
* Visiting Researcher – Privacy & Mobile Data at [National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan](http://www.nii.ac.jp/en/)
* Postdoctoral Researcher – Privacy & Smart Environments at [University of Mannheim, Germany](http://www.uni-mannheim.de/1/english/)


My PhD research was focused on Security in Connected Smart Objects. Since then I have broadened my interests to include the following topics:

* **Security of AI Agents**
Secure delegation of AI agents on top of protocols such as A2A and MCP, focusing on privacy-respecting identity binding, human-in-the-loop consent, and policy-based authorization.

* **Trustworthy AI**
Development of methods and frameworks for assessing the trustworthiness of AI systems, such as Bias, particularly in critical infrastructures and regulated environments. Contributions include dataset bias assessment, subjective logic models for trust, and evidence-based reasoning in multi-agent AI settings.

* **Identity Management and Digital Identity Wallets**
Cryptographic identity architectures supporting unlinkability, selective disclosure, and zero-knowledge proofs.  Achieving higher level of assurance in privacy-preserving identity wallets through trusted computing. User acceptance factors for selective disclosure on identity wallets through real-worl deployments and user studies.

* **Cybersecurity and Privacy in Connected & Automated Mobility (C-ITS & CCAM)**
Trustworthiness assessment in multi-agent and distributed systems based on subjective logic. Privacy-respecting security architectures for V2X systems, including pseudonym schemes, revocation strategies, and comparative evaluations of credential technologies such as PKI and Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA).

* **Privacy Engineering and Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs)**
End-to-end integration of privacy principles into system architecture, including privacy by design methodologies, privacy design patterns, and compliance-aligned privacy threat modeling. Longstanding contributor to PET development in EU research and standardization contexts.
