We need to ensure that credentials and (private) keys can only become available to this specific Holder as the actual owner of the issued Wallet credentials. That means the level of control and credential management assurance relies solely on possessing and controlling the private key, which in current designs is a software-based key. However, the use of a software keystore introduces many security risks and raises trustworthiness issues.</p> <p>One of the necessary measures to solve such security gaps, is to isolate the keys from the Holder while still being stored in the user’s domain. There are several types of isolation defined in the literature that can be achieved through the incorporation of trusted computing technologies, i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hardware Secure Module (HSM)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)</a>. All such trusted anchors provide reliable, tamper-evident, and secure processing units (including support for crypto operations, key storage, and authentication) that offer a trustworthy environment for executing applications</p> <p><strong>Device Binding:</strong> And still, this is not enough. What is still missing is the binding of identity data to the Holder (Holder Binding). This binding is based on a unique identifier representing the Holder, i.e., a secret key. One way to have high confidence is to make sure that the secret key is bound to the Wallet managing the identity data. For instance, DIF defines this property as Device Binding, that is, “a building block that enables a differential credential security model by anchoring a hardware-generated key (e.g., TPM Key) to the credential.”</p> <p>PRIVÉ solves this problem by making sure that the key stored in the secure element cannot be used unless it is proven that the wallet’s software has not been tampered with or altered in any unauthorized manner. This involves verifying that the wallet’s software has not been modified since it was last validated by a wallet certification authority. The integrity check might include verifying cryptographic hashes of the wallet software against known good values.</p> <h2 id="cryptographic-solution-the-door-protocol">Cryptographic solution: the DOOR protocol</h2> <p><img src="/assets/img/PRIVE_overview_architecture.png" width="600"></p> <p>PRIVÉ has extended <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22846-4_14" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DAA-A: Direct anonymous attestation with attributes</a> to create a new cryptographic protocol (called DOOR) that satisfies the above requirements of user binding and device binding. DAA-A is a strong privacy-preserving authentication scheme that supports the construction of Verifiable Presentations with selective disclosure through the encoding of each attributes as a seperate key. The authenticity of the hidden attributes is proven by the integrated zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs.</p> <p>PRIVÉ has added an extra layers of security on top of DAA-A by constructing policy regulations to govern the usage of the DAA Key when signing attribute claims.</p> <ul> <li>One such policy ensures the binding of the DAA Key to the Holder’s authenticated Wallet, which in turn enables the binding of the issued identity data to the Holder as the intended recipient. This is done by the VC Issuer through binding issued attributes to the anonymized part of the DAA credential.</li> <li>An additional policy binds the use of the DAA Key with the configuration of the wallet, so that it can be used if and only if the Wallet software integrity has not been altered in an unauthenticated manner.</li> </ul> <p>More details can be found in our paper <a class="citation" href="#Prive2024_10538525">(Larsen et al., 2023)</a>.</p> <h2 id="implementation-the-trusted-component-tc-bridge">Implementation: The Trusted Component (TC) Bridge</h2> <p>The Trusted Component (TC) Bridge is the main artifact delivered by PRIVÉ, which embodies the implementation of the solution and offers an API so that it can be seamlessly integrated with any EUDI wallet implementation. From an engineering perspective, the TC Bridge is a mechanism that allows seamless interaction between the secure hardware components of a user’s device (such as a Trusted Platform Module, or TEEs) and the various services and applications of the EUDI that need to utilize the cryptographic operations and privacy properties offered by PRIVÉ solution.</p> <p>The TC Bridge has been engineered in order to offer the following properties:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Mediation between Wallet and Trusted Component:</strong> The TC Bridge acts as an intermediary layer that connects the digital wallet with the hardware-based security features offered by the Trusted Component. The TC Bridge abstracts the complexity of direct hardware interactions, providing an API through which the software can request cryptographic operations, such as signing, encryption, or key management, without needing to handle the low-level details of the hardware.</li> <li> <strong>Credential Handling and Attestation:</strong> The TC Bridge is responsible for facilitating the secure handling of credentials. For example, when a credential needs to be signed or verified, the TC Bridge routes these requests to the Trusted Component, which performs the necessary cryptographic operations in a secure environment. Additionally, the TC Bridge handles the generation and management of attestation certificates, such as the Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA) certificates, which are used to prove the integrity and authenticity of the credentials without compromising user privacy.</li> <li> <strong>Key Management and Usage Policies:</strong> A critical role of the TC Bridge is enforcing key management and usage policies as defined by the system’s security architecture. The Trusted Component typically holds cryptographic keys in a highly secure manner, and the TC Bridge ensures that these keys are only used according to predefined policies. This includes restrictions on how and when keys can be used, ensuring that they cannot be misused or accessed by unauthorized software or processes.</li> <li> <strong>Interoperability with Multiple Trusted Components:</strong> The TC Bridge is designed to be interoperable with various types of Trusted Components, including different versions of TPMs, secure enclaves, or other hardware security modules. This flexibility allows the digital identity system to function across a range of devices and platforms, ensuring broad compatibility and adoption. The TC Bridge abstracts the differences between these components, providing a consistent API that the application layer can rely on.</li> </ol> <h2 id="real-world-use-case-and-demonstration">Real-world Use Case and Demonstration</h2> <p>PRIVÉ project has implemented and integrated anonymous credentials in a real-world Wallet. A big part of the project has been to also implement a Use Case scenario, in order to demontrate the selective disclosure functionality in a real scenario. More specifically, PRIVÉ’s Use Case focused on educational credentials, such as diplomas. Towards this direction, one major initiative currently in Europe is the development of <a href="https://europass.europa.eu/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDC)</a>, which provides a standardized way to issue, share, and verify educational qualifications and achievements across Europe. EDC facilitates the digital transformation of learning credentials, ensuring they are portable, verifiable, and interoperable across different systems and borders.</p> <p>The integration of selective disclosure within <a href="https://europass.europa.eu/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDC)</a> allows learners to present only the necessary credentials to various stakeholders, such as potential employers or other educational institutions, without revealing their entire educational history. In this work, we take the specific example of job application process.</p> <p>Selective disclosure for the job application process becomes a powerful tool, because it can enable blind recruitment, which aims to reduce biases in hiring by concealing certain applicant attributes that could lead to discrimination. For example, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has shown that revealing age information during the first stages of recruitment process can lead to significant age discrimination.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/PRIVEUseCase.png" width="700"></p> <p>PRIVÉ demonstrated the cryptographic solution in a real-world demonstrator with EUDI and EDCs for Learning. The scenario is the following: a job applicant is required to apply for a position as a mid-level software engineer through a job portal. The applicant must provide proof of their identity, educational qualifications, and work experience — all of which are managed and presented through their mobile wallet.</p> <p><strong>Credential Issuers:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Previous Employer: The user has a credential issued by their previous employer that details their work experience. This credential is securely stored in the mobile wallet.</li> <li>eIDAS Node: The eIDAS node acts as an issuer of the electronic identification (eID) credential, which verifies the user’s identity in accordance with eID eIDAS Profile.</li> <li>EDC Issuer (Educational Credential): The user’s educational background, such as a diploma or degree certificate, is issued by an educational institution that complies with the European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDC) framework.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Mobile Wallet:</strong></p> <p>The user’s mobile wallet is the central repository where all verifiable credentials are stored. The wallet leverages the PRIVÉ solution (TC Bridge), which supports hardware-backed security features to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the credentials. The wallet allows the user to manage these credentials and selectively disclose only the necessary attribute values.</p> <p><strong>Application Process:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Verifiable Presentation: When applying for the software engineering position, the user generates a Verifiable Presentation (VP) from their mobile wallet. This VP selectively discloses only the credential attributes (e.g. educational qualifications, and work experience) required by the job portal. These are described in a policy sent by the the job portal to the user.</li> <li>Policy Enforcement: The job portal through a policy dictates what kind of credentials and attributes are necessary for the application. The mobile wallet ensures that only the relevant credentials that meet this policy are shared, maintaining the user’s privacy.</li> </ul> <h2 id="user-acceptance-of-selective-disclosure-in-eudi">User Acceptance of Selective Disclosure in EUDI</h2> <p>The European Commission sets a very ambition goal: at least 80% of citizens should be able to use a digital ID solution to access key public services by 2030. To achieve this goal, we need to start talking about the factors that affect users’ adoption of the technology. In the PRIVÉ project, a comprehensive user adoption analysis was conducted to understand the factors influencing the adoption of EUDI Wallets, particularly focusing on the secure and privacy-preserving aspects offered by PRIVÉ’s solution.</p> <p>Given that Identity Wallets is a new technology that most users have not experience using before, trust plays a crucial role in their decision to adopt it.</p> <p>To evaluate our model, we conducted a comprehensive user trial focusing on the above job application scenario using eIDAS and European Digital Credentials for Learning. This trial gathered empirical data on user interactions with the EUDI Wallet and their perceptions of its features, particularly those related to selective disclosure and trust.</p> <p>The user trial for the PRIVÉ project involved recruiting a diverse group of participants through an open call, ensuring representation across various demographics, technological proficiency levels, and geographic regions. During the trial, the users installed the identity wallet on their mobile phones and tried it out in a hypothetical scenario of applying for a job. At the end, feedback was collected through a questionnaire that users had to answer.</p> <p>The PRIVÉ project utilized and extended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_acceptance_model" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Technology Acceptance Model</a> (TAM) as the foundational framework for collecting feedback and analyzing user adoption factors. The TAM model had to be extended to capture how much different aspects of trust affect their decision to adopt the technology.</p> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div id="Prive2024_10538525" class="col-sm-10"> <div class="title">Achieving Higher Level of Assurance in Privacy Preserving Identity Wallets</div> <div class="author"> B.
