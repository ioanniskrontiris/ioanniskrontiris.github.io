TrustChain is part of the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative.</p> <p>PRIVE designs and demonstrates a solution that uses anonymous credentials in <a href="[https://](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home)">EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI)</a>. Through this cryptographic mechanism, EUDI achieves secure and privacy-preserving authentication and identification.</p> <p>Private key</p> <p>Selective disclosure Anonymous credentials enable selective disclosure. The user may choose to reveal a subset of his credential attributes, or nothing at all other than the fact that his attributes satisfy a given policy. The user then convinces the verifier, via a zero-knowledge proof, of the authenticity of the disclosed information.</p> <p>How can someone be sure that they really belong to the claimed entity? On a technical level, this translates into Holders having control of their own VCs and DIDs through their Wallets, which can ensure that credentials and (private) keys can only become available to this specific Holder as the actual owner of the issued Wallet credentials. Since it is only the Holder (as the Identity Owner) that knows the (private) key associated with a DID, the level of control and credential management assurance relies solely on possessing and controlling the private key, which in current designs is a software-based key. However, the use of a software keystore introduces many security risks and raises trustworthiness issues [5], [6]. So the above challenge translates into the more technical question: How can a Verifier be sure that the respective key of the Holder presenting a VC remains under her control, and cannot be used by any other unauthorized entity?</p> <p>One of the necessary measures to solve such security gaps, and reach LoA “high”, is to isolate the keys from the Holder while still being stored in the user’s domain. There are several types of isolation defined in the literature that can be achieved through the incorporation of trusted computing technologies, i.e., Hardware Secure Module (HSM), Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). All such trusted anchors provide reliable, tamper- evident, and secure processing units (including support for crypto operations, key storage, and authentication) that offer a trustworthy environment for executing applications</p> <p>Another requirement to achieve LoA ”high” is the binding of identity data to the Holder (Holder Binding). This binding is based on a unique identifier representing the Holder, i.e., a secret key. One way to have high confidence is to make sure that the secret key is bound to the Wallet managing the identity data. For instance, DIF defines this property as Device Binding, that is, “a building block that enables a differential credential security model by anchoring a hardware-generated key (e.g., TPM Key) to the credential.”</p> <ol> <li> <p>Selective Disclosure with Unlinkability: DOOR employs a modified version of the Direct Anonymous Attestation with Attributes (DAA-A) protocol, which allows users to selectively disclose only the necessary attributes during a transaction. Each attribute is cryptographically bound to the user’s identity using a unique key, protected by hardware-based Roots of Trust (RoT). This ensures that the disclosed attributes cannot be linked across different transactions, even if they involve the same attribute or identity credential. By utilizing zero-knowledge proofs, DOOR guarantees that the identity provider and relying parties cannot collude to trace user activities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Hardware-Backed Identity Assurance: To meet the high Level of Assurance required by eIDAS 2.0, DOOR integrates hardware-based key management to securely store and manage the cryptographic keys associated with identity attributes. This approach prevents unauthorized access to identity credentials, ensuring that only the legitimate user can present their credentials. The hardware protection also ensures that even in the event of device compromise, the identity credentials remain secure and non-transferable.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2> <p>The DOOR protocol achieves compatibility across different wallet implementations primarily through its use of the credential bridge concept. This concept enables DOOR to seamlessly integrate with a variety of identity wallets by acting as a mediator between the secure hardware components (like Trusted Platform Modules or cloud-based secure elements) and the identity credentials stored within the wallet. The credential bridge ensures that even if a wallet operates with different underlying technologies or storage methods, DOOR can securely manage and present credentials by linking them through this intermediary layer.</p> <h2 id="real-world-use-case-and-demonstration">Real-world Use Case and Demonstration</h2> <p>PRIVE project has implemented and integrated anonymous credentials in a real-world Wallet. A big part of the project was to implement also a Use Case scenario to demontrate the selective disclosure functionality in a real scenario. More specifically, PRIVE’s Use Case focused on educational credentials, such as diplomas. Towards this direction, one major initiative currently in Europe is the development of <a href="[https://](https://europass.europa.eu/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials)">European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDC)</a>, which provides a standardized way to issue, share, and verify educational qualifications and achievements across Europe. EDC facilitates the digital transformation of learning credentials, ensuring they are portable, verifiable, and interoperable across different systems and borders.</p> <p>The integration of selective disclosure within <a href="[https://](https://europass.europa.eu/en/stakeholders/european-digital-credentials)">European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDC)</a> allows learners to present only the necessary credentials to various stakeholders, such as potential employers or other educational institutions, without revealing their entire educational history. In this work, we take the specific example of job application process.</p> <p>Selective disclosure for the job application process becomes a powerful tool, because it can enable blind recruitment, which aims to reduce biases in hiring by concealing certain applicant attributes that could lead to discrimination. For example, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has shown that revealing age information during the first stages of recruitment process can lead to significant age discrimination.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/PRIVEUseCase.png" width="600"></p> <p>PRIVE demonstrated the cryptographic solution in a real-world demonstrator with EUDI and EDCs for Learning. The scenario is the following: a job applicant is required to apply for a position as a mid-level software engineer through a job portal. The applicant must provide proof of their identity, educational qualifications, and work experience—all of which are managed and presented through their mobile wallet.</p> <ol> <li>Credential Issuers:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Previous Employer: The user has a credential issued by their previous employer that details their work experience. This credential is securely stored in the mobile wallet.</li> <li>eIDAS Node: The eIDAS node acts as an issuer of the electronic identification (eID) credential, which verifies the user’s identity in accordance with EU regulations. This eID is also stored within the mobile wallet.</li> <li>EDC Issuer (Educational Credential): The user’s educational background, such as a diploma or degree certificate, is issued by an educational institution that complies with the European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDC) framework. This credential is stored alongside others in the mobile wallet.</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Mobile Wallet:</li> </ol> <p>The user’s mobile wallet is the central repository where all verifiable credentials are stored. The wallet leverages the PRIVÉ solution, which supports hardware-backed security features to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the credentials. The wallet allows the user to manage these credentials and selectively disclose only the necessary attribute values.</p> <ol> <li>Application Process:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Verifiable Presentation: When applying for the software engineering position, the user generates a Verifiable Presentation (VP) from their mobile wallet. This VP selectively discloses only the credential attributes (e.g. educational qualifications, and work experience) required by the job portal. These are described in a policy sent by the the job portal to the user.</li> <li>Policy Enforcement: The job portal through a policy dictates what kind of credentials and attributes are necessary for the application. The mobile wallet ensures that only the relevant credentials that meet this policy are shared, maintaining the user’s privacy.</li> </ul> <h2 id="user-acceptance-of-selective-disclosure-in-eudi">User Acceptance of Selective Disclosure in EUDI</h2> <p>The European Commission sets a very ambition goal: at least 80% of citizens should be able to use a digital ID solution to access key public services by 2030. To achieve this goal, we need to start talking about the factors that affect users’ adoption of the technology. In the PRIVÉ project, a comprehensive user adoption analysis was conducted to understand the factors influencing the adoption of EUDI Wallets, particularly focusing on the secure and privacy-preserving aspects offered by PRIVÉ’s solution.</p> <p>Given that Identity Wallets is a new technology that most users have not experience using before, trust plays a crucial role in their decision to adopt it.</p> <p>To evaluate our model, we conducted a comprehensive user trial focusing on the above job application scenario using eIDAS and European Digital Credentials for Learning. This trial gathered empirical data on user interactions with the EUDI Wallet and their perceptions of its features, particularly those related to selective disclosure and trust.</p> <p>The user trial for the PRIVÉ project involved recruiting a diverse group of participants through an open call, ensuring representation across various demographics, technological proficiency levels, and geographic regions. During the trial, the users installed the identity wallet on their mobile phones and tried it out in a hypothetical scenario of applying for a job. At the end, feedback was collected through a questionnaire that users had to answer.</p> <p>The PRIVÉ project utilized the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the foundational framework for collecting feedback and analyzing user adoption factors. The TAM model had to be extended to capture how much different aspects of trust affect their decision to adopt the technology.</p> <h2 id="other-digital-signature-schemes-compatible-with-anonymous-credentials">Other Digital Signature Schemes Compatible with Anonymous Credentials</h2> <p>BBS/BBS+</p> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Ioannis Krontiris.
